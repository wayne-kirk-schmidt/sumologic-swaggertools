Sumo Logic Swagger Tools
========================

The Swagger tools are helper functions to mine specific information from the Sumo Logic API file.

Installing the Scripts
=======================

The scripts are command line based, designed to be used within a batch script or DevOPs tool such as Chef or Ansible.
Each script is a python3 script, and the complete list of the python modules will be provided to aid people using a pip install.

You will need to use Python 3.6 or higher and the modules listed in the dependency section.  

The installation steps are as follows: 

    1. Download and install python 3.6 or higher from python.org. Append python3 to the LIB and PATH env.

    2. Download and install git for your platform if you don't already have it installed.
       It can be downloaded from https://git-scm.com/downloads
    
    3. Open a new shell/command prompt. It must be new since only a new shell will include the new python 
       path that was created in step 1. Cd to the folder where you want to install the scripts.
    
    4. Execute the following command to install pipenv, which will manage all of the library dependencies:
    
        sudo -H pip3 install pipenv 
 
    5. Clone this repo using the following command:
    
        git clone git@github.com:wks-sumo-logic/sumologic-swaggertools.git

    This will create a new folder
    
    6. Change into this folder. Type the following to install all the package dependencies 
       (this may take a while as this downloads all of the libraries necessary):

        pipenv install
        
Dependencies
============

See the contents of "pipfile"

Script Names and Purposes
=========================

The scripts are organized into sub directories:

    1. ./bin - has all of the scripts to work with the sumologic-api.yaml file.

NOTE: 

This will not download the sumologic-api.yaml file directly.
Instead, this uses the requests module to retrieve the API definition into memory.

In short, this makes all of the tools the equivalent of an itelligent cat and grep.

To Do List:
===========

* Specify the location to get the api file from

* Provide a meams to checksum the files
